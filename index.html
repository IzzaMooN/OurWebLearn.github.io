<h1> This is our first web </h1>
<p> I want you to learn some basic of html code that I just learn </p>
<p>First of all every code need to use "<" and ">" </p>
<p> you can text code " strong " mean <strong>Bold</strong> </p>
<p> and also you can text code " em " mean <em>Italic</em> </p><br>

<p> Ok next is "<br>" we use to creat a new line for our paragrahp </p> <br><br>

<p> And next we have " a href="" " to creat a <a href="">link</a> </p><br>
<p> Please don't click it , nothing will happen because I didn't insert any link</p><br><br> 

<p> Last we have " img src="" " that we use to insert an Image from internet </p><br>
<p> It better to use image from internet so whoever access our web , they will be see the image too </p>
<p> Example : <br><br>
	<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/97/07/dd/9707ddbef620d0e91d6e799ff20b59bc.jpg"
